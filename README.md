# Project Icarus

## Overview

Developed as the Capstone project in a sixteen week coding bootcamp, Project Icarus is an image sharing site designed to allow for easy uploading and sharing of images of any type. It is designed to be fully responsive and was built using HTML & CSS, utilising Bootstrap5 for the interface, and Django for the backend. The current name, Project Icarus was originally meant to just be a placeholder and meant to express my feeling that I'm flying just that little bit too close to the sun with this project. I've decided to embrace both the feeling and the name, though!

# Feature Overview
Project Icarus aims to provide a simple, calm image sharing platform in the vein of the early days of Instagram. With its mellow colours, rounded corners, and intentionally limited to sharing photos only, it is meant as an antidote to today's ceaseless onslaught of rage-based engagement bait. As such, it focusses on providing a stage for single photographs and a platform for creators and visitors to enter into a meaningful dialogue about said photo.

The app is fully responsive and the following features have been implemented:

- User Registration
- Login & Logout functionality
- Post creation & image upload for registered users only
- Comment creation for registered users only
- Post & comment deletion for registered users only
- "My Posts" page to provide registerd users weith a single location to view and edit their post.
- Intuitive app navigation
- View post functionality for all users

# UX Design

The primary aim of Project Icarus is to provide a calming and intentional platform to upload and share their photos. As such, the interface has been stripped back to its basics,

## Design Statement

The design aims to generate a calm ambience, using pastel greens and yellows to create a soothing atmosphere. The design also avoids the use of sharp corners to further enhance this calm atmosphere. This design language is implemented throughout the site, with only the login and signup pages deviating from this somewhat. Since Project Icarus is a photo sharing website, the photos themselves have pride of place, both on the main view, the 'Image Feed', and on the individual image view.
